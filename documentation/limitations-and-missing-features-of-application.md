# Limitations and missing features of the application

The horse application is a  course project. Time for development of this application was limited. Therefore not all features are finished.

Anybody can create a teacher user. The teacher user has features that are too advanced for any user.

Setting a horse for riders is not as easy to do as I would like it to be.

Teachers can attend lessons and lessons do not have teachers.

The time of the lesson is not validated any how. The lesson can end before it begins and lasts for an arbitary amount of time.

There is no check if there are two lessons at the same time.
