# Limitations and missing features of the application

The horse application is a  course project. Time for development of this application was limited. Therefore not all features were finished.

Anybody can create a teacher user. A teacher user has some admin functions that are limited to administrator personel only. A different approach would be better opinion.

Setting a horse for riders is not as easy to do as I would like it to be.

Teachers can apply for the lessons and lessons do not have teachers.

The time of the lesson is not validate any how. The lesson can end begore it begins and is as long as you want it to be.

No check if there are two lessons at a same time.

Overall I am quite happy how the application turned out.
